# NUnit Tests

## Running NUnit Tests - Visual Studio

The tests use NUnit to run instead of the inbuilt Visual Studio test system (more cross platform) <br \>
In order to run the tests within Visual Studio:

First make sure the NUnit Test Adapter is installed for Visual Studio under the Extensions

* Within Visual Studio 2013 Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Install NUnit Test Adapter

Next we need to Build QtSharp.Tests (don't try to run it as a project, just build)

* Right click the QtSharp.Tests project and select Build

Next make sure the test / platform setting is set to x32 to match the architecture setting of the QtSharp library

* Test Menu -> Test Settings -> Default Processor Architecture -> X86

Next Run the Tests

* Test Menu -> Windows -> Test Explorer
* wait a while for it to analyse the available tests
* Click Run All
